===========================
This section finds which key to start searching from, and which key to stop searching at
If there's no "key" constraints then we'll just search every single key and filter by value
===========================

For each condition in the query (example: key > 3 AND value < 100):
    if constraint is a "key" constraint:
        Find out if there's an "equals" operator
            if so, set condition_equal_val to the value

        Find out if there's a "not-equals" operator
            if so,

        Find the absolute minimum key
        Find the absolute minimum value

        Find the absolute maximum key
        Find the absolute maximum value

If there's a condition_equal...
    do tree.locate on the condition_equal_val
    do tree.readForward to get the key, value tuple
    print this

Otherwise...
    look through every key between absolute_min_key and absolute_max_key
    absolute_min_key defaults to 0, and absolute_max_key defaults to the end of the while loop
